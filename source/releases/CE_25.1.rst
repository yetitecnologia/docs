25.1  "Ultimate Unicorn" Series
===========================================================================================



For an entire decade now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

25.1, nicknamed "Ultimate Unicorn", features numerous MVC/API conversions,
improved security zones support and documentation, ZFS snapshot support,
a new UI look with a light and dark theme, PHP 8.3, FreeBSD 14.2 plus much
more.

25.1.2 (February 28, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This was supposed to hit earlier this week, but some weeks are like this
one now where QA takes more time than usual.  Of note is the move of Dnsmasq
to MVC and the ChartJS update to version 4 which is bundled with nice updates
for widgets and the system health graphs.

The roadmap for 25.7 was also published `[1] <https://opnsense.org/about/road-map/>`__ .  The IPsec and OpenVPN legacy
parts will move to the plugins so that the functionality can live there
in community support tier.  Since Kea remains a bit of an odd choice we will
be offering DHCP support via Dnsmasq as a new standard feature which also
offers seamless DHCP lease registration some people keep looking for.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: adjust gateway widget to use the intended caching mechanism
* system: thermal sensors widget can now select individual sensors to display plus UX changes
* system: handle dev.pchtherm temperatures in the thermal dashboard widget (contributed by Joe Roback)
* system: use new apply button partial in tunables page

The "page-system-groupmanager-addprivs" privilege was removed since the page does not exist anymore. A multi-purpose privilege editor has been added under the existing "page-system-usermanager-addprivs" instead.
* PPP devices can no longer be configured on the interface settings page. To edit the device settings use the native PPP device edit page instead.
* FreeBSD 14.2 comes with the stock pf(4) behaviour regarding ICMPv6 neighbour discovery state tracking which was avoided so far in 24.7.x.
* Let's Encrypt ends support for the OCSP Must Staple extension on 30.01.2025. Issuance requests will fail if this option is still enabled past this date.

25.1.b (December 19, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The 25.1 series will include FreeBSD 14.2 so we are putting this BETA
version out based on the latest development state.  This is not meant
for production use but all plugins are provided and future updates of
installations based on these images will be possible.

https://yeti.tec.br/yetisense/releases/25.1/

There is a bit more work to be done yet most of the milestones have
already been reached.  If you have a test deployment or would like to
check out some of the new features these images are for you.  Together
we can make OPNsense better than it ever was.

The final release date for 25.1 is January 29.  A release candidate
will follow in early January.

Highlights over version 24.7 include:

* system: restructure PPP to accomodate IPv6-only deployments
* system: implement persistent notifications banner
* system: dashboard widget for certificate expiry and renew
* system: high availablilty status MVC/API conversion
* system: users and groups MVC/API conversion
* system: advanced trust settings page
* system: ZFS snapshot GUI
* reporting: RRD health graph refactoring
* firewall: improved security zones support and documentation
* ipsec: advanced settings MVC/API conversion
* unbound: merge domain overrides into query forwarding
